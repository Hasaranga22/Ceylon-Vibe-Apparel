        <h4>SECTION 5 | THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h4>
        <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the
            extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.</p>
        <p>However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction
            processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them
            for
            your purchase-related transactions.</p>
        <p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in
            which
            your personal information will be handled by these providers.</p>
        <p>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a
            different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves
            the
            services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the
            jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.</p>
        <p>Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no
            longer
            governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.</p>

        <h4>LINKS</h4>
        <p>When you click on links on our store, they may direct you away from our site. We are not responsible for the

        <h4>SECTION 6 | SECURITY</h4>
        <p>To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to
            make
            sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.</p>

        <h4>COOKIES</h4>
        <p>To keep track of cart data, WooCommerce makes use of 3 cookies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>woocommerce_cart_hash</li>
            <li>woocommerce_items_in_cart</li>
            <li>wpwoocommerce_session</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first two cookies contain information about the cart as a whole and help WooCommerce know when the cart
            data
            changes. The final cookie (wpwoocommerce_session) contains a unique code for each customer so that it knows
            where to find the cart data in the database for each customer. No personal information is stored within
            these
            cookies.</p>
